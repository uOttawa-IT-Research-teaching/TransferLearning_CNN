# Transfer learning

In our previous tutorials, we explored the fundamentals of deep neural networks (DNN). We delved into the inner workings ofhow DNNs learn with the data. This tutorial gives a cursory overview of how convolutional neural networks (CNN) work and why they are used in image and video inferencing. A more programmatic approach to CNNs is covered in the [CNN for Image Inferencing tutorial](https://github.com/uOttawa-IT-Research-teaching/DeepLearning_CNN).
