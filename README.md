# Transfer learning

If working on uOttawa's Ganymede cluster, please use the tensorflow kernel for the 2 notebooks. The notebooks work best using GPU devices.

Transfer learning is a powerful technique in machine learning that involves taking a pre-trained model, which has been trained on one task, and reusing it for another related but different task. This approach significantly reduces the amount of data required for training and often leads to better performance than training from scratch. In the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transfer learning has proven particularly effective across various domains such as computer vision and natural language processing.

The process starts with understanding Deep Neural Networks (DNN), which are a fundamental component in deep learning architectures. These networks consist of multiple layers that perform increasingly complex transformations on input data, allowing them to learn hierarchical representations of the information. The depth of these networks is what gives them their nameâ€”deep neural networks. CNNs are a specialized DNN variant optimized for visual data.

In the case of CNNs, transfer learning involves using pre-trained models specifically designed for image recognition tasks. These models have been trained on vast amounts of data and achieve high accuracy in recognizing features such as edges, textures, shapes, and patterns. By leveraging these pre-trained models, we can take advantage of their learned feature detectors without having to train the network from scratch using a small dataset or starting with random weights.

Transfer learning with CNNs involves taking the convolutional base of a pre-trained model, and replacing the final classification layer(s) with our own custom classifier, which is typically trained on top of this frozen feature extractor. This approach allows us to fine-tune the network for our specific task while keeping most of the learned features intact.

In summary, transfer learning in CNNs leverages pre-trained models to efficiently solve new and related tasks, saving time and resources compared to training a model from scratch. By understanding deep neural networks and their role in transfer learning, we can effectively apply these techniques to various image recognition problems.
