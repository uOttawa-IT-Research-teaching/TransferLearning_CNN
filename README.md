# Transfer learning

If working on uOttawa's Ganymede cluster, please use the tensorflow kernel for the 2 notebooks. The notebooks work best using GPU device.

In our previous tutorials, we explored the fundamentals of deep neural networks (DNN). We delved into the inner workings of how DNNs learn with the data. This tutorial is about transfer learning which leverages pre-trained models to solve new, related tasks with minimal data and effort. This powerful technique is used in fields like natural language processing and computer vision. A more application and deployment-based approach to CNNs is covered in the [CNN for Image Inferencing tutorial](https://github.com/uOttawa-IT-Research-teaching/DeepLearning_CNN).

Comment: Do we actually have DNN ready? If not, it is better to not build on that here. If we are going to have it ready when this notebook is going to be published, disregard this comment. even if we have that ready, it is worth refreshing he info here about what was covered there a little but and how this training is related to that.
