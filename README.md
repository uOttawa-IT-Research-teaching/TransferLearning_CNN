# Transfer learning

If working on uOttawa's Ganymede cluster, please use the tensorflow kernel for the 2 notebooks.

In our previous tutorials, we explored the fundamentals of deep neural networks (DNN). We delved into the inner workings ofhow DNNs learn with the data. This tutorial is about transfer learning which leverages pre-trained models to solve new, related tasks with minimal data and effort. This powerful technique is is used in fields like natural language processing and computer vision. A more application and deployment-based approach to CNNs is covered in the [CNN for Image Inferencing tutorial](https://github.com/uOttawa-IT-Research-teaching/DeepLearning_CNN).
